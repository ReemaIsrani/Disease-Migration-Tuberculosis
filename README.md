# Disease-Migration-Tuberculosis
Changes in climatic condition, air pollution and population growth have a measurable impact on the local conditions and the specific ecology and epidemiology of different contagious diseases (airborne, vector-borne and water-borne). This project aims at using AI-based machine learning and Machine Learning techniques for understanding the spread of Tuberculosis in India. The environmental factors such as Rainfall, Average Temperature, Relative Humidity and pollution parameters such as SO2, NO2 and RSPM were taken into consideration in order to perform analysis.
